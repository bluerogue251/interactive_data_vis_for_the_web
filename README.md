# Data visualization exercises

This is a [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) site I made to try out the [d3 javascript data visualization library](http://d3js.org/).

I followed exercises from Scott Murray's book, [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345)
